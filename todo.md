# TODO

* Read paper on Fisher Vectors.

## Priority

## Title

## Abstract

## Introduction & Related Work
* Write a paragraph about the deep feature paper on affordances.
* Write about the Stark paper.
* See if there is something to cut.

## Methodology
* Check that the derivative for the $l_1$ norm is properly defined. 

## Experiments

### Accuracy For 30/70
* Learn all optimal parameters for good classification and sound feature selection. 
* Do a final run. 
* Collect and insert numbers into paper tables.
* Put in feature magnitude weights plots in paper. 

### As a Function of Number of Exemplars
* Do a test of what accurcacy the optimal parameters for the full case gives.
* Think about a measure of change over number of exemplars.

### Human vs Robot Labeling
# 


## Conclusion & Future Work
* Write it.
