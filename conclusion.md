We have shown...

Some insights 

* Using simple approaches like kNN with the right representation achieving high accuracy is not difficult. 
* Most objects that affords the same action are quite similar in the intra-category cluster they belong to.
    - Using feature selection helps us take advantage of this redundancy 

- Comparing to the 2015 ICRA paper?
- Comparing affordance and object categorization???
