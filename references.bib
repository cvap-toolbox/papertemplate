Problem: To learn a robot from sensory-motor experince what is a container and not a container. And to use the sensory-motor experience to classfiy novel objects to a specific category.

The robot drops a cube into a container that is either up or up-side down and oberseves the outcome. It then tries to push the container and depedning on the co-movement or no co-movement with the cube it can learn a functional representation of the object.

In some sense this is clustering based upon outcome experience rather than then clustering of features; so there is a temporal aspect to it that is interesting.

The not so cool part is that the clustering into the two groups container and not a container is not so convincing, and that the classificiation that they do on novel objects based upon the image features they extracted are kind of riddiciolous.

Review: 

This paper developes a method for gesture interaction with a mouse / point{\&}amp;click GUI. They hardware used is a simple common webcam on a ordinary computer thus no extra or advanced hardware is used i.e. things lie in the algorithm rather than in the hardware. There are two systems one in 2D and one 3D. Pretty boring.

title = {{Vision-based hand gesture recognition for human-computer interaction}},
journal = {The Universal Access Handbook},
year = {2009},
annote = {<b>Some thoughts</b>
Detection is separate from learning and understanding gestures etc. Since all we have to know is how a hand looks like in order to detect it. 

Learning and understanding must be put in the context of previously aquired knowledge or combinations of such. 

Gestures understanding should be correlated with facial expressions and body poses. Body language. Seems that no one has added this approach from what I have read so far. Imagine having an paralell HMM for facial expressions and pose. Also how about the Tobii eye detecion this is also very related to some gestures like pointing at objects, thinking and showing emotions.   

<b>Review</b>
An overview of hand/gesture recognition. The authors identify three building blocks of hand gesture inference: detection, tracking and recognition.

<b>Detection</b> consists of the detection of hands and the segementation of the image  to understand the context and remove irrelevant data. There are several features that are used in the detection stage. 

- <b>Skin color</b>; which is problematic since there is a lot of variance of the skin color in human beings and there is also lot of different lightning conditions adding up to the ambiguity.

- <b>Shape</b>: Edge detection to find the hands. Often combined with color since there is a lot of ambiguity and occlusion. To deal with the clutter some people have used particle filters. There has also been some research into morphology however it seems kind of rudimentary. I am sure something could be done to enhance the morphology approach.

- <b>Pixel values</b>: the ordinary template matching and boosting approach.

- <b>Motion</b>: seems like this feature is a bit unused except for the motion residue idea that hands move more than other objects in the scene. I guess if one wants to detect the hands one starts at frame 1 and then move on to the next frame. So real time seems a bit difficult maybe more applicable when analyzing a sequence.

<b>Tracking</b>
The tracking part deals with keeping track of where the hands go. Basically so that one does not have to do the detection over  again. 

- <b>Templates</b>: basically once the hands have been detected that part is used as template for detecting the hand in the next frame. There are also contour blob templates that are deformed to fit the hand contour in the next frame. Good approach but very sensitive to clutter. 

- <b>Optimal estimation techniques</b>: Kalman filtering framework. Hard to understand since I have forgotten what Kalman filtering is...

- <b>Mean shift algorithm</b>: should investigate how it works.

- <b>Particle filtering</b> {\&}amp; condensation algorithm to be investigated.

<b>Recognition</b>
Interpreting the semantics that the hand(s) location, posture, or gesture conveys. The paper defines two categories: 1) interpretation of control applications such as drawing lines etc. A bit unclear definition actually. What this should mean is actually action understanding. Right? Or would this get filed under 2 as well. Very ambigious and unclear.  2) Interpretatioon of gestures, postures, signs etc. Then they talk about how this phase is context driven and how HMMs are a good framework for the understanding. Some approaches are outlined below.

- <b>Template matching</b>: Same procedure as with facerecognition. The only difference here is that here we are essentially dealing with a 360 degree object but for faces there is only about 180 which certainly makes recognition a bit harder. A lot of people seems to be doing multiple views templates plus a coordination with previous frames matched templates. There is also some kind histogram idea which doesn't seem to work out due to the ambigiuous nature of the problem.

- <b>PCA</b>: Seems to be the ordinary reduce dimensions and then compare against training data procedure. Not fantastically interesting.

- <b>Boosting</b>: Very vague description in this paragraph. Seems to describe a boosting approach to clustering or using hiearchial trees. Again problems with ambigiuity and lightning conditions.

-<b> Contour and silhouette matching</b>: Sort of a repitition of the detection chapter. Very much based on template matching again. Biggest problem is again ambiguity and clutter. There seems to be an idea to use the matching to restrict the area where the recognition is using contours and then use the silhouette to match. Again the approach is the obvious combine features...

- <b>Model-based recognition methods</b>. Starts out with some obvious statements such that the classification success depends on choosing the right features. Who would have known...They also cite some paper that has evaluated features and figured out that velocity features are...}

journal = {{\ldots} Symposium Workshop on Learning {\ldots}},
year = {2001},
annote = {Summary: 

Deals with SSH abstraction. Especiially the SSH causal layer. The causal layer deals with sensor views and control actions, and how they affect each other. They use a SOM(Self-organizing Maps) for representing the SSH view set. This fits in with modelling everything as an abstract graph. 

They have some good points in the SSH Causal Layer chapter of qualities of how to handle sensory input.  

First they define a triple of edges {\&}lt;V,A,V'{\&}gt; such that action A taken under view V indicates V' will happen.

They state that a robot must be able to recognize its current sensor input as one of its set of known views. This means that views must be clustered or at least be discriminated but this is too hard given the noisy input. Therefor they choose to formulate the problem as maximization of the predictive accurace of the {\&}lt;V,A,V'{\&}gt; relations, i.e., the confidence it will see the view V' after taking action A in view V. 

Take home message seems to be to reformulate the recognition problem as a relation maximization problem since then one does not have to deal with the infinite space of possible noisy inputs. 

<b>Relation to my work:</b> possibly how we can formulate the problem as relational problem rather than view causality learning problem. <b>This thought could be expanded upon.</b>

<b>Summary</b>
Segement perfect 3D object models using a segmentation algorithm based upon Gaussian curvature and concaveness. An object is represented using superquadratics.   The segementation is such that 7 differerent superquadratics are used for each object. 

They then label a superquadratic  for each object as the graspable part. They train a Neural Network on the labeled data.

To generate a grasps they do anlytical computations on the detected graspable part. The analytical parts are a force-closure test and a handkinematics test.

No real data is tested. Paper was before Kinect came out.

Terms to look up</b> 
Passive Mechanical Adaption. 

<b>Thoughts</b> 
It is interesting that not many people seem to use heuristics when doing grasping etc. For example in the glass gripping case in fig2 after 7000 iterations the grasp has the thumb down, while a human if it would carry an object always would see too it to have the palm underneath the object unless you are to pick up the object and stab someone. Obviously grasping is inherintly task depedent. 

<b>Review</b>: 
Really good and well written paper; I can't judge the quality of the results though. 

The paper is divided into two sections. The first section researches lower dimensional representation of grasps using PCA. The lower dimensional grasps are then put into a cost function operating in lower dimensional space together with the mechanical constrains/readings of hand sensors. The cost function is then optimized with respect to the object targeted for grasping to find the best grip. I do not quite understand the exact way this is done. If there is predetermined point for gripping the object and the hand chooses the best one for that point. So for example if we are gripping a pole, then the authors have pre-set that we should grip in the middle; and so approaches with the hand and lets the method find the best grip.

The second part moves onto explore using a human to guide the hand to a good grip positioin i.e. wrist and position. The modified algorithm with a more easily calculated cost function then finds the best grip position.

Thoughts:</b>
Authors mentions that most approaches(10yrs ago) use a matching approach i.e. matching the current hand pose to a number of predefined handposes. The authors remarks that hand pose estimation is not viewpoint invariant which makes the whole case a hard nut to crack...They also mention a paper by Wu et al. that uses a sort of brute force approach by comparing to multiple viewpoints. Basically a discrete 360 matching it seems.  

<b>Terms to check:</b> 
Stochastic  visual segmentation, Hu moments(which seems to be functions of central image moments), 


<b>Review:</b>
The problem formulations for the authors is to automatically find the 3D hand pose from a monocular color sequence for every frame in that sequence. Positive characteristics of the author's system are no restriction on hand shapes, no manual initilization, view-point independence and good error recovery. 

To them the pose tracking problem is a regression problem. Since the matching of a monocular feature vector is a many to one problem due to pose problem not being viewpoit invariant i.e. the image seen in 2D could map to the same 3D model depending on which viewpoint one chooses. To solve this they train a probabilistic mixture of functions via the EM algorithm. The functions take visual features and give the DOF of the 3D hand model. The functions are a 1 layer of NN. After the function training is done a feedback function is trained to find the function that produces the best matching to the features, basically a function inverse if I understood it right. The inverse functions give 3D hand hypothesises that are measured in a energy function to pick out the best hypothesis.

The hands are tracked using skincolor. They have a smart approach to the first detection. Instead of detecting the hands they detect the face since face detections is more robust, and then they use the skincolor in the face to find the skincolor patches in the image and then the hands. There is a problem with occlusion in which the method fails. 

The features they use I think are just PCA of viewpoints of the 3D hands they have generated.

There are a lot of things that are bit weird here. I think mainly the explanation of the SMA and its mixture of probabilistic and deterministic. Further on the future process is a bit difuse. They don't mention speed either.      
Basically the paper seems like the first of a two part sequal.

<b>General thoughts</b>
- When you generate the database of possible poses which poses should have the database contain? One could probably take out a lot of clenched fists poses since some are so unlikely.
- I don't understand why they don't cluster the data in some sense. I mean comparing against a gigantic database is all fine but categorizing the poses and then comparing the images against a much denser subset would grant you much finer granularity and better matches. GPLVM clustering!
- On this there is also the Chamfer system way of doing things. Basically grouping similar templates and ordering them in a decision tree. See here for more http://www.gavrila.net/Research/Chamfer_System/chamfer_system.html
- There's also an interesting idea about contour protusions "whose length/width ratio exceeds a threshold" are to be detected as fingers which means even more discrimination could be determined. 

<b>Review</b>
Monocular 3D hand pose estimation.
The basic approach of this paper for hand pose recognition is to match the 3D hand to a gigantic database of 3D hand images using canny edges. It also discusses how to create the 3D hand dataset and good measures for similarity. They also discuss how a real time implementation would look like. The way the authors approach real life application is by skincolor detection and constrained backgrounds etc. i.e. again skimping away from the actual task of doing this effin unconstrained.

They start out by modeling the hand using 16 links this leads to 20 DOF, this means they don't take into consideration any wrist movements and such. Seemingly they don't deal with detecting the hand in a full image but seem to do the estimation against bounding boxed edges of hands. They also assume the size of the hand is fixed meaning that they have no moving camera. 

They generate all their training data by a 3D program - first they decide how many poses they should use(400-50000) and then they generate about 90 viewpoints of each pose. 

The inference is done via comparing canny edges using the so called Chamfer distance. I have no idea if the Chamfer distance is a good metric for edge image distances. If the true hand pose is contained in the top ten neighbouring images suggested by the metric then they consider the right pose has been estimated. }

Thoughts</b> 
- About his bounding box thing: is there a similar use for Dan's boyfriend's bounding box algorithm or did that have nothing to do with any of this? Should check this.   


<b>Review</b>
Building on previous work in: 3D Hand Pose Estimation by Finding Appearance-Based Matches in a Large Database of Training Views. 

The authors present hand pose estimation that is independent from viewpoint and handles clutter in what manner and to which extent is a bit unclear.

Basically they build on previous work using a big database of poses to match against a test image. They do a bit more with the Chamfer distance which measures the distance between binary images. It seems they find an approximation which is still robust but faster. They also develope a line segmentation approach that helps discriminate in early stages of the inference. 

First they use something called DCD to discriminate among a lot of pictures since the feature is really fast and then they press on with the Chamfer distance metric, line measure and histogram for fine tuning. 

The results they get are not super promising it seems. The accuracy seems to be around 60 percent or so. Unfortunatley their whole paper is a bit messy so it is really hard to understand exactly the tables 1-2 without a more thorough read. I haven't exactly understood the line features and the DCD. So I would need a third read. }

Unscented Klamn filter, Hogg features, Second degree implicit surface

<b>Thoughts</b>: 
Basically a matching problem done via Kalman filtering. Novelty is perhaps the 3D model and using that for generating silohouetts. Otherwise the paper is pretty unsexy and badly written. Evaluation / results is also pretty nonexistant which seems to imply that method doesn't work fantastically...

<b>Review:</b>
Quite unclear what this paper does in detail from reading the introduction and conclusion sections. After reading the entire paper things are a bit clearer but this paper is lacking in the explanation of how the actually tracking is done.

This is a short summary of how I think this is done: They build a 3D model of a real hand, composed of 27 different objects. Using the hand model they can match the edges/silohouetts of the model hand against the edges/silhouettes in the image. The matching of the two is made by an Unscented Kalman Filter. How that is done is a bit unclear since my knowledge about Kalman filters is almost zero.}

Thoughts</b>
I should do all the labs in Josephine's image recognition course and the exam. 

<b>Review</b>
This paper tests different features and different template methods for a cascade classifier on hand pose recognition. The two features evaluated are edge and color.

The <b>classifier</b> is some sort of tree-based cascade classifier. Basically its cascade evaluation search over a coarse grid and then on a further refined grid. The method is not explained very good but seems to be to create some sort of binary grid. The authors refer to a paper of theirs on filtering using a tree-based estimator. 

The <b>edge feature</b> is evaluated using different kinds of template methods to see which one is more robust to differences in the template vs the image the template is appplied to. To improve robustness one can either blur the edge image or template before correlating or use the Chamfer or Hausdorff distance measure. This paragraph is a bit unclear if I remember it correctly the Chamfer distance is a blurring. The authors present 3 different template approaches for the edge feature. Centre template is basically a single shape template using both the Chamfer and Hausdorff distance. <b>Marginalized template</b> is a template which is more attuned to a specific region in the template and setting the model parameters based upon on this region and not the whole template. <b>Linear classifier learnt from image data</b> basically learning the template by supervised learning using a perceptron 1000 positive and 4000 negative examples.

The <b>skin color feature</b> is a bit vaguely presented refering to Stenger's PhD thesis. My notion of how this feature is used with templates is the following: model the skincolor as a Gaussian in rg-space and the background as a uniform distribution, extract a log-likelihood map of the skincolor and a map for the background color. Both features can be written as a cost function representing the full log-likelihood or deducted likelihood which apparently is equivalent to matching a template. No thorough motivation is given though.

Introduces the GTM. The GTM is a latent variable model where the latent variables are nodes on a grid. The prior on the latent variables are a mixture of Dirac delta functions. The latent variables are mapped via a matrix W to the data space Y. By using a nonlinear transform of the X values the mapping is written as y = Wf(x).  The mapping parameters / weights, W, plus the rest of parameters are found via maximizing the log likelihood for the data, Y. The authors don't use nonlinear optimization techniques such as Newtonian or conjugate gradients etc. but instead formulates the maximization as a EM problem via the realization that the model is mixture model.

Compared to SOM it seems to have some nice qualities such as a probability distribution over the latent space and convergence guarantees etc. However it is slower than the optimized SOM that takes almos half the time to complete in one of the experiments. This is to be expected since it is a severely ill-conditioned problem.

<b>Review
</b>Introduces the concept of <b>collaborative retrieval</b>. It means augmenting a item query task with user information of how the user ranks and sees items in its universe. Basically what it means is that they take into account the users preferences when they make a query. What they also do is to take queries into account when training the model i.e. the training data is augmented with queries.

<b>Review</b>
Pose estimation from silhouettes using templates. The main problem is formulated as learning one-to-many mapping functions that map from the feature space to the state space.

As the authors describe it: this paper has introduced a framework for single camera pose estimation and tracking that is a hybrid of learning based and generative model based approaches. So basically it is a whole lot of methods added up to create this framework which means it will take some time to go through this paper... }

<b>Summary:</b>

Find a topological representation of objects, that is, a Reeb graph. Good thing about Reeb graphs is that they are invariant to rotation. Bad part is that they take time to compute. 

Clasify each object to belong to the class which is closests to the class protoype using the PATH algorithm.

Learn grasps with a glove. For each grasp represent it as set of the parts describing the object(I am guessing the nodes). Classify the grasped part as the one with most contact points. 

Learn a task precedence graph to learn the tasks. 

Select grasps from a set pre-defined grasps for the part being grasped.

I like this paper. However, it is unclear how good it will work in reality...

<b>Review</b>
Not a very good paper in terms of general writing. Actually it is full of grammatical errors even some math errors etc. Overall the text poorly explains concepts and just moves around a lot. 

The authors begins to conclude that the GPVLM is not a good density model. By density model is meant the distribution over the observed data(here denoted as z)(Why do they use z btw? It is just irritating.). 

They then proceeds to formulate another training cost function than the log marginal likelihood since that cost function is focused on solving a regression scenario. The cost function the authors formulate is based on a general leave-out estimator. The leave-one-out scheme is implemented simply by removing the point x_i from the mean function, due to computational costs the point is not removed from the covariance. The authors also states that the one-to-one relationship in the GP is removed in the cost function. <b>In equation 2 this is evident since it is a Gaussian sum where each point is dependent on the means and covariances of all other points except itself.</b> Overfitting in density modeling means high density beeing assigned to training data while the test will have low density - I am guessing this means sort of a spiked density at training points in the GP regression. For the LOO cost function it is not enough to leave one point out so they leave out more than one. This will ensure that evening out of the probability mass across all points I am guessing.

The author especially talks about: (1) The ability to express intermediate states of the learning process, (2) resilience in the face of partial destruction of the represented information and (3) the ability to express a meaningful response when a process is prematurely asked for the result of the computation.

In the conclusion he sets some measurements for quantitative analysis of any representation: 

- How resilient{\ldots}.under which destruction.
- Which sequences of observations can and cannot be represented completely.
- What kinds of partial information are usable{\ldots}for premature demands for an answer.
- How bad is a given class of disaster, for a given request in a given context?

Basically simple learning of environments and objects. Deals with creating categories out of several snapshots of objecs from a laser range finder. The clustering is using a simple distance measure.

annote = {Review: 

In this paper the authors work on task planning. They reason that the robot should recognize pre-states and post-states of the task to be able to do high-level planning.

The authors use learning by demonstration. Basic actions are learned by moving the robot arm recording the movements. 

Preconditions 
The authors argue that preconditions must be flexible. By making the features independent to each other with relation to the specific action the can vary the possible pre-conditional states. In order to detect  irrelevant conditions they compare feature variance - regarding small variations as an indicator for relevance. The same holds for effects of actions.

The feature variance detection is done by clustering the feature space for a number of clusters, K. For each possible clustering they  sum the intra cluster distances to its mean, and if this value is lower than a specific value for some K then the feature is relevant for the action. To judge if a certain feature fulfills the condition its distance to the mean is calculated and if it is below a threshold then it is considered fulfilled.

One problem is also that the assume {\'a} priori known object models or rather that model they learn is per object. They do learn a distribution for gripper pose + finger placement over the object based upon human demonstration, however, the model is per object and does not generalize it seems.
The ICL or BIC criterion might be an interesting approach to prune the number of inducing points in the GPLVM-cluster method.}

Hysteresis thresholding

<b>Review</b> 
Real-time tracking of hands using skin color feature. 

Skin color detection is done via  probabilistic thresholding. The probabilities are calculated from the image via some notion of skincolor in the image. The online probabilities are a weighted sum of the off-line trained images and the previous image frame statistics to let it be less sensitive to illumination and image quality etc.

The tracking of the hands is done via a certain kind of hypothesis / truth matching. The hypothesizes are inherited from the previous frame and then made to be matched with the current frame. Matching is done corresponding to a specific ruleset matching pixels to skin color blobs. Hypothesizes are thrown away if they don't match the reality.

The testing of the method is performed on a 3825 frames long clip of some dude waving his hands really really fast{\ldots} The labeling is done correctly in every frame but they don't give any more insight to exactly how good it is in general i.e. thin experiment section, but seemingly promising.
