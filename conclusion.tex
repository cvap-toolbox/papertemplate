\section{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}

We have shown\ldots{}

Some insights

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Using simple approaches like kNN with the right representation
  achieving high accuracy is not difficult.
\item
  Most objects that affords the same action are quite similar in the
  intra-category cluster they belong to.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Using feature selection helps us take advantage of this redundancy
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Comparing to the 2015 ICRA paper?
\item
  Comparing affordance and object categorization???
\end{itemize}
